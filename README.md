My project is a top 3 countdown of iconic games of the 2000s. I decided to model my website after countdown videos which I enjoy watching on youtube. I included various media including images and songs in my project to make the experience for the user more entertaining. 

I have four html files: index.html, which is the main page users land on, which hass an introduction to the content of the website. Next there are three .html files, one for ech of the games in the list. ATVOFFROAD.html, thrill.html, and shrek2.html. Each includes images and music as well as colorful themes. Each of the .html files has an accompanying css file, and shrek has a scss file, which generates into a css.
